# A fresh attempt to a fully functioning dockersied private blockchain initially with two nodes and a bootnode

* Durin the first attempt everything seemed to working but all of a sudden the mining stopped and I couldn't make transactions among the nodes.

* I will be changing the name of my ethereum network as well. As puppeth I think keeps the already generated networks in its memory.

* There was also the issue of imported accounts in metamask, I will be solving that issue this time as well. There must not be any issues ideally as things seemed to work well outside the docker world even with the imported accounts.
